Note: removed all ligands (that is, HETATM lines), but kept crystal water

Removed 1 crystal water with a distance > 0.4nm from the protein

MD simulation:
	Estimate for number of atoms in envelope = 19882 - will generate 98 simulation frames
	Simulation time (ps)    = 52
	Equilibration time (ps) = 3
	Simulation system contained 9201 solute atoms and 27758 water molecules.
	Added 8 Na+ to neutralize the simulation cell.

SAXS/WAXS calculation:
	Maximum q scattering vector [nm-1]:                   6
	Number of solute and pure-sovlent simulation frames:  98
