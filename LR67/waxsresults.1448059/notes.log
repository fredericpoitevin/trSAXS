Removed 40 crystal water with a distance > 0.4nm from the protein

MD simulation:
	Estimate for number of atoms in envelope = 14765 - will generate 123 simulation frames
	Simulation time (ps)    = 64.5
	Equilibration time (ps) = 3
	Simulation system contained 5546 solute atoms and 22020 water molecules.
	Added 5 Na+ to neutralize the simulation cell.

SAXS/WAXS calculation:
	Maximum q scattering vector [nm-1]:                   20
	Number of solute and pure-sovlent simulation frames:  123
	Simulation time discarded for equilibration (ps):     3
	Correcting solvent density to [e/nm3]:                334
	Number of q-points for spherical average:             Max{500, 0.20*(D*q)^2}  [D = diameter of envelope]
	Distance of envelope from solute [nm]:                0.7
	Maximum diameter of solute [nm]:                      9.69414
	Number of atoms used for rotational fit:              1037
	Buffer subtraction scheme:                            Buffer intensity reduced by solute volume

Guinier fit:
	Rg [A] = 24.4786
	For comparison: Rg(solute) [A] = 23.7326
