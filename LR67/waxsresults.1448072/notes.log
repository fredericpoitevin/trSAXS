Residue SO4-356 was removed. 5 atoms, with 2.40 contacts per atom.

Removed 4 crystal water with a distance > 0.4nm from the protein

MD simulation:
	Estimate for number of atoms in envelope = 12550 - will generate 140 simulation frames
	Simulation time (ps)    = 74
	Equilibration time (ps) = 4
	Simulation system contained 5256 solute atoms and 16003 water molecules.
	Added 4 Na+ to neutralize the simulation cell.
